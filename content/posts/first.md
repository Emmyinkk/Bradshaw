Last year I was fortunate enough to join WPP as the Head of Cloud Hub, our team exists to deliver cloud to the WPP group of companies supporting their businesses and end clients. We create fantastic products for our customers and clients to use, we make the cloud more accessible, keep everyone safe, and we do that by building an extraordinary team.

I’m delighted to share that we’ve just opened 16 new roles in WPP on our Cloud Hub team in Bucharest and London!

### What do we do?
Cloud Hub exists to deliver cloud to the WPP group of companies. We do that by creating fantastic products, making cloud easier, keeping everyone safe, and building an extraordinary team.


### Where?
